Conway's Game of Life
---------------------

Author: Antonio Foglia


This is an attempt at creating a simulation for Conway's game of life
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Below are the steps
through which I hope to arrive at the final goal (star indicates the step I
am currently on):

  - python implementation with a 2D array *
  - python implementation with a sparse array
  - python visualization using matplotlib
  - better visualization method (processing.py?)
  - implementation with frontend to publish on website
